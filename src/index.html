      <img src="/assets/pngwing.com (3).png" width="800px" height="300px">
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cryptocurrency, sometimes called crypto-currency or crypto, is
        any form of currency that exists digitally or virtually and uses
        cryptography to secure transactions. Cryptocurrencies don't have a central issuing or regulating authority,
        instead using a
        decentralized system to record transactions and issue new units.</p>

      <br>
      <h1 id="what-is-cryptocurrency">What is cryptocurrency?</h1>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cryptocurrency is a digital payment system that doesn't rely on
        banks to verify transactions. It’s a peer-to-peer system that can
        enable anyone anywhere to send and receive payments. Instead of being physical money carried around and
        exchanged in the real world,
        cryptocurrency payments exist purely as digital entries to an online database describing specific transactions.
        When you
        transfer cryptocurrency funds, the transactions are recorded in a public ledger. Cryptocurrency is stored in

      <p>There are thousands of cryptocurrencies. Some of the best known include:

        <br><br>Bitcoin:

        <br>Founded in 2009, Bitcoin was the first cryptocurrency and is still the most commonly traded. The currency
        was developed by
        Satoshi Nakamoto – widely believed to be a pseudonym for an individual or group of people whose precise identity
        remains unknown.

        <br><br>Etherium:

        <br>Developed in 2015, Ethereum is a blockchain platform with its own cryptocurrency, called Ether (ETH) or
        Ethereum.
        It is the most popular cryptocurrency after Bitcoin.

        <br><br>Litecoin:

        <br>This currency is most similar to bitcoin but has moved more quickly to develop new innovations, including
        faster
        payments and processes to allow more transactions.

        <br><br>Ripple:

        <br>Ripple is a distributed ledger system that was founded in 2012. Ripple can be used to track different kinds
        of
        transactions, not just cryptocurrency. The company behind it has worked with various banks and financial
        institutions.

        <br><br>Non-Bitcoin cryptocurrencies are collectively known as “altcoins” to distinguish them from the original.

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cryptocurrencies are usually built using blockchain technology.
        Blockchain describes the way transactions are recorded into
        "blocks" and time stamped. It's a fairly complex, technical process, but the result is a digital ledger of
        cryptocurrency
        transactions that's hard for hackers to tamper with.

        <br><br>In addition, transactions require a two-factor authentication process. For instance, you might be asked
        to enter
        a username and password to start a transaction. Then, you might have to enter an authentication code sent via
        text to your
        personal cell phone.

        <br><br>While securities are in place, that does not mean cryptocurrencies are un-hackable. Several high-dollar
        hacks
        have cost cryptocurrency start-ups heavily. Hackers hit Coincheck to the tune of $534 million and BitGrail for
        $195 million,
        making them two of the biggest cryptocurrency hacks of 2018.

        <br><br>Unlike government-backed money, the value of virtual currencies is driven entirely by supply and demand.
        This can create wild swings that produce significant gains for investors or big losses. And cryptocurrency
        investments are
        subject to far less regulatory protection than traditional financial products like stocks, bonds, and mutual
        funds.

      <h1 id="Mining">What Is Crypto Mining?</h1>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most people think of crypto mining simply as a way of creating
        new coins. Crypto mining, however, also involves validating cryptocurrency
        transactions on a blockchain network and adding them to a distributed ledger. Most importantly, crypto mining
        prevents the double-spending
        of digital currency on a distributed network.

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cryptocurrency, sometimes called crypto-currency or crypto, is
        any form of currency that exists digitally or virtually and uses
        cryptography to secure transactions. Cryptocurrencies don't have a central issuing or regulating authority,
        instead using a
        decentralized system to record transactions and issue new units.</p>

        banks to verify transactions. It’s a peer-to-peer system that can
        enable anyone anywhere to send and receive payments. Instead of being physical money carried around and
        exchanged in the real world,
        cryptocurrency payments exist purely as digital entries to an online database describing specific transactions.

      <H1 id="what-is-a-blockchain">What Is a Blockchain?</H1>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A blockchain is a distributed database that is shared among the
        nodes of a computer network. As a database, a blockchain
        stores information electronically in digital format. Blockchains are best known for their crucial role in
        cryptocurrency
        systems, such as Bitcoin, for maintaining a secure and decentralized record of transactions. The innovation with
        a
        blockchain is that it guarantees the fidelity and security of a record of data and generates trust without the
        need for a
        trusted third party.

        <br><br>In addition, transactions require a two-factor authentication process. For instance, you might be asked

      <h1 id="Mining">What Is Crypto Mining?</h1>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most people think of crypto mining simply as a way of creating
        new coins. Crypto mining, however, also involves validating cryptocurrency
        transactions on a blockchain network and adding them to a distributed ledger. Most importantly, crypto mining
        prevents the double-spending
        of digital currency on a distributed network.
        <br>
        <br>Like physical currencies, when one member spends cryptocurrency, the digital ledger must be updatedby
        debiting one account and
        crediting the other. However, the challenge of a digital currency is that digital platforms are easily
        manipulated. Bitcoin’s distributed
        ledger, therefore, only allows verified miners to update transactions on the digital ledger. This gives miners
        the extra responsibility of
        securing the network from double-spending.
        <br>
        <br>Meanwhile, new coins are generated to reward miners for their work in securing the network. Since
        distributed ledgers lack a
        centralized authority, the mining process is crucial for validating transactions. Miners are, therefore,
        incentivized to secure
        the network by participating in the transaction validation process that increases their chances of winning newly
        minted coins.
        <br>
        <br>In order to ensure that only verified crypto miners can mine and validate transactions, a proof-of-work
        (PoW)
        consensus protocol has been put into place. PoW also secures the network from any external attacks.

      <br><Br>A database usually structures its data into tables, whereas a blockchain, like its name implies,
      structures its
      data into chunks (blocks) that are strung together. This data structure inherently makes an irreversible
      timeline of
      data when implemented in a decentralized nature. When a block is filled, it is set in stone and becomes a part
      of this
      timeline. Each block in the chain is given an exact time stamp when it is added to the chain.

      <h1 id="how-does-a-blockchain-work">How Does a Blockchain Work?</h1>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The goal of blockchain is to allow digital information to be
        recorded and distributed, but not edited. In this way,
        a blockchain is the foundation for immutable ledgers, or records of transactions that cannot be altered,
        deleted,
        or destroyed. This is why blockchains are also known as a
        distributed ledger technology (DLT).

        <br><Br> First proposed as a research project in 1991, the blockchain concept predated its first widespread
        application in use: Bitcoin, in 2009. In the years since, the use of blockchains has exploded via the creation
        of various cryptocurrencies, decentralized finance (DeFi) applications, non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and smart
        contracts.
