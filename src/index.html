        <h1 id="crypto-meaning">Cryptocurrency – meaning and definition</h1>
        <p>Cryptocurrency, sometimes called crypto-currency or crypto, is any form of currency that exists digitally or virtually and uses 
            cryptography to secure transactions. Cryptocurrencies don't have a central issuing or regulating authority, instead using a 
            decentralized system to record transactions and issue new units.</p>
            
            <br>
            <h1 id="what-is-cryptocurrency">What is cryptocurrency?</h1>
        <p>Cryptocurrency is a digital payment system that doesn't rely on banks to verify transactions. It’s a peer-to-peer system that can 
            enable anyone anywhere to send and receive payments. Instead of being physical money carried around and exchanged in the real world, 
            cryptocurrency payments exist purely as digital entries to an online database describing specific transactions. When you 
            transfer cryptocurrency funds, the transactions are recorded in a public ledger. Cryptocurrency is stored in digital wallets.
            <br><br>Cryptocurrency received its name because it uses encryption to verify transactions. This means advanced coding is involved 
            in storing and transmitting cryptocurrency data between wallets and to public ledgers. The aim of encryption is to provide 
            security and safety.<br><br>The first cryptocurrency was Bitcoin, which was founded in 2009 and remains the best known today. Much of the interest in cryptocurrencies is to trade for profit, with speculators at times driving prices skyward.</p>
            <br>
            <h1 id="how-does-cryptocurrency-work">How does cryptocurrency work?</h1>
        <p>Cryptocurrencies run on a distributed public ledger called blockchain, a record of all transactions updated and held by currency 
            holders.<br><br>Units of cryptocurrency are created through a process called mining, which involves using computer power to 
            solve complicated mathematical problems that generate coins. Users can also buy the currencies from brokers, then store and 
            spend them using cryptographic wallets.<br><br>If you own cryptocurrency, you don’t own anything tangible. What you own is a key 
            that allows you to move a record or a unit of measure from one person to another without a trusted third party.
            <br><br>Although Bitcoin has been around since 2009, cryptocurrencies and applications of blockchain technology are still 
            emerging in financial terms, and more uses are expected in the future. Transactions including bonds, stocks, and other financial 
            assets could eventually be traded using the technology.</p>
        
            <br>
            <h1 id="Cryptocurrency-examples">Cryptocurrency examples</h1>
            <p>There are thousands of cryptocurrencies. Some of the best known include:

            <br><br>Bitcoin:
                
            <br>Founded in 2009, Bitcoin was the first cryptocurrency and is still the most commonly traded. The currency was developed by 
            Satoshi Nakamoto – widely believed to be a pseudonym for an individual or group of people whose precise identity remains unknown.
                
            <br><br>Etherium:
                
            <br>Developed in 2015, Ethereum is a blockchain platform with its own cryptocurrency, called Ether (ETH) or Ethereum. 
            It is the most popular cryptocurrency after Bitcoin.
                
            <br><br>Litecoin:
                
            <br>This currency is most similar to bitcoin but has moved more quickly to develop new innovations, including faster 
            payments and processes to allow more transactions.
                
            <br><br>Ripple:
                
            <br>Ripple is a distributed ledger system that was founded in 2012. Ripple can be used to track different kinds of 
            transactions, not just cryptocurrency. The company behind it has worked with various banks and financial institutions.
                
            <br><br>Non-Bitcoin cryptocurrencies are collectively known as “altcoins” to distinguish them from the original.</p>
            <br>
            <br>
            <h1 id="Is-Crypto-safe">Is cryptocurrency safe?</h1>
            <p>Cryptocurrencies are usually built using blockchain technology. Blockchain describes the way transactions are recorded into 
               "blocks" and time stamped. It's a fairly complex, technical process, but the result is a digital ledger of cryptocurrency 
                transactions that's hard for hackers to tamper with.

                <br><br>In addition, transactions require a two-factor authentication process. For instance, you might be asked to enter 
                a username and password to start a transaction. Then, you might have to enter an authentication code sent via text to your 
                personal cell phone.
                
                <br><br>While securities are in place, that does not mean cryptocurrencies are un-hackable. Several high-dollar hacks 
                have cost cryptocurrency start-ups heavily. Hackers hit Coincheck to the tune of $534 million and BitGrail for $195 million, 
                making them two of the biggest cryptocurrency hacks of 2018.
                
                <br><br>Unlike government-backed money, the value of virtual currencies is driven entirely by supply and demand. 
                This can create wild swings that produce significant gains for investors or big losses. And cryptocurrency investments are 
                subject to far less regulatory protection than traditional financial products like stocks, bonds, and mutual funds.</p>

                <p>A blockchain is a distributed database that is shared among the nodes of a computer network. As a database, a blockchain 
                    stores information electronically in digital format. Blockchains are best known for their crucial role in cryptocurrency 
                    systems, such as Bitcoin, for maintaining a secure and decentralized record of transactions. The innovation with a 
                    blockchain is that it guarantees the fidelity and security of a record of data and generates trust without the need for a 
                    trusted third party.

                <Br><br>One key difference between a typical database and a blockchain is how the data is structured. A blockchain 
                        collects information together in groups, known as blocks, that hold sets of information. Blocks have certain storage 
                        capacities and, when filled, are closed and linked to the previously filled block, forming a chain of data known as 
                        the blockchain. All new information that follows that freshly added block is compiled into a newly formed block that 
                        will then also be added to the chain once filled.
                    
             <br><Br>A database usually structures its data into tables, whereas a blockchain, like its name implies, structures its 
                        data into chunks (blocks) that are strung together. This data structure inherently makes an irreversible timeline of 
                        data when implemented in a decentralized nature. When a block is filled, it is set in stone and becomes a part of this 
                        timeline. Each block in the chain is given an exact time stamp when it is added to the chain.</p>
                <Br>
                <br>
                 <h1 id="how-does-a-blockchain-work">How Does a Blockchain Work?</h1>
             <p>The goal of blockchain is to allow digital information to be recorded and distributed, but not edited. In this way, 
                        a blockchain is the foundation for immutable ledgers, or records of transactions that cannot be altered, deleted, 
                        or destroyed. This is why blockchains are also known as a 
                        distributed ledger technology (DLT).

                 <br><Br> First proposed as a research project in 1991, the blockchain concept predated its first widespread 
                        application in use: Bitcoin, in 2009. In the years since, the use of blockchains has exploded via the creation 
                        of various cryptocurrencies, decentralized finance (DeFi) applications, non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and smart
                         contracts.</p>
                <Br><br>
                <h1 id="blockcain-decentralization">Blockchain Decentralization</h1>
                <p>Imagine that a company owns a server farm with 10,000 computers used to maintain a database holding all of its client’s 
                    account information. This company owns a warehouse building that contains all of these computers under one roof and has 
                    full control of each of these computers and all of the information contained within them. This, however, provides a single 
                    point of failure. What happens if the electricity at that location goes out? What if its Internet connection is severed? 
                    What if it burns to the ground? What if a bad actor erases everything with a single keystroke? In any case, the data is 
                    lost or corrupted.

                    <br><br>What a blockchain does is to allow the data held in that database to be spread out among several network nodes 
                    at various locations. This not only creates redundancy but also maintains the fidelity of the data stored therein—if 
                    somebody tries to alter a record at one instance of the database, the other nodes would not be altered and thus would 
                    prevent a bad actor from doing so. If one user tampers with Bitcoin’s record of transactions, all other nodes would 
                    cross-reference each other and easily pinpoint the node with the incorrect information. This system helps to establish 
                    an exact and transparent order of events. This way, no single node within the network can alter information held within it.
                    
                    <br><br>Because of this, the information and history (such as of transactions of a cryptocurrency) are irreversible. 
                    Such a record could be a list of transactions (such as with a cryptocurrency), but it also is possible for a blockchain 
                    to hold a variety of other information like legal contracts, state identifications, or a company’s product inventory.</p>
                <br><br>
                <h1 id="transparency">Transparency</h1>
                <p>Because of the decentralized nature of Bitcoin’s blockchain, all transactions can be transparently viewed by either having 
                    a personal node or using blockchain explorers that allow anyone to see transactions occurring live. Each node has its own 
                    copy of the chain that gets updated as fresh blocks are confirmed and added. This means that if you wanted to, you could 
                    track Bitcoin wherever it goes. 

                    <br><Br>For example, exchanges have been hacked in the past, where those who kept Bitcoin on the exchange lost everything. 
                        While the hacker may be entirely anonymous, the Bitcoins that they extracted are easily traceable. If the Bitcoins 
                        stolen in some of these hacks were to be moved or spent somewhere, it would be known.
                    
                    <br><Br>Of course, the records stored in the Bitcoin blockchain (as well as most others) are encrypted. This means that 
                        only the owner of a record can decrypt it to reveal their identity (using a public-private key pair). As a result, 
                        users of blockchains can remain anonymous while preserving transparency.</p>
                <br><br>
                <h1 id="is-blockchain-secure">Is Blockchain Secure?</h1>
                <p>Blockchain technology achieves decentralized security and trust in several ways. To begin with, new blocks are always stored linearly 
                    and chronologically. That is, they are always added to the “end” of the blockchain. After a block has been added to the end of the 
                    blockchain, it is extremely difficult to go back and alter the contents of the block unless a majority of the network has reached a 
                    consensus to do so. That’s because each block contains its own hash, along with the hash of the block before it, as well as the 
                    previously mentioned time stamp. Hash codes are created by a mathematical function that turns digital information into a string of 
                    numbers and letters. If that information is edited in any way, then the hash code changes as well.

                    <br><Br>Let’s say that a hacker, who also runs a node on a blockchain network, wants to alter a blockchain and steal cryptocurrency 
                        from everyone else. If they were to alter their own single copy, it would no longer align with everyone else’s copy. 
                        When everyone else cross-references their copies against each other, they would see this one copy stand out, and that hacker’s 
                        version of the chain would be cast away as illegitimate. 
                    
                    <br><Br>Succeeding with such a hack would require that the hacker simultaneously control and alter 51% or more of the 
                        copies of the blockchain so that their new copy becomes the majority copy and, thus, the agreed-upon chain. Such an attack 
                        would also require an immense amount of money and resources, as they would need to redo all of the blocks because they would 
                        now have different time stamps and hash codes. 
                    
                    <br><br>Due to the size of many cryptocurrency networks and how fast they are growing, the cost to pull off such a feat probably 
                    would be insurmountable. This would be not only extremely expensive but also likely fruitless. Doing such a thing would not go 
                    unnoticed, as network members would see such drastic alterations to the blockchain. The network members would then hard fork off 
                    to a new version of the chain that has not been affected. This would cause the attacked version of the token to plummet in value, 
                    making the attack ultimately pointless, as the bad actor has control of a worthless asset. The same would occur if the bad actor 
                    were to attack the new fork of Bitcoin. It is built this way so that taking part in the network is far more economically incentivized 
                    than attacking it.</p>
